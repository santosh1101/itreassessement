        <em>What is Web Design?</em></h1>
        <p align="left" style="Bigcalson" size="10">
            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br/>
            refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software<br/>
            development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop<br/>
            browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has<br/>
            become ever-increasingly important.
